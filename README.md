# SensorMonitor-MQTT 📡🖥️  
*Qt 6 Widgets dashboard & MQTT sensor simulator*

## Overview
SensorMonitor is a small **desktop laboratory** showing how to :

* simulate temperature / humidity / pressure sensors with random data,
* publish these values to a **Mosquitto** broker (`sensors/#` topics),
* subscribe and display them live in a **Qt 6 Widgets** GUI,
* stay 100 % C++11 – no Qt Mqtt module, only `libmosquittopp`.

## Features
| Component            | Tech / API                              | Notes |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| **Simulator**        | `QCoreApplication`, `QTimer`, `mosquittopp` | Publishes every 2 s, QoS 1, retain flag |
| **Dashboard (GUI)**  | `QMainWindow`, `QLCDNumber`, `QProgressBar` | Auto-updates on message reception |
| **MQTT bridge**      | `MosqQtClient` wrapper                  | Thread-safe: callbacks → Qt signals |
