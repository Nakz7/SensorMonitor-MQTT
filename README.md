# SensorMonitor üì°üñ•Ô∏è  
*Qt 6 Widgets dashboard & MQTT sensor simulator*

## Overview
SensorMonitor is a small **desktop laboratory** showing how to :

* simulate temperature / humidity / pressure sensors with random data,
* publish these values to a **Mosquitto** broker (`sensors/#` topics),
* subscribe and display them live in a **Qt 6 Widgets** GUI,
* stay 100 % C++11 ‚Äì no Qt Mqtt module, only `libmosquittopp`.
